      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I was a software developer for several years before deciding to be a full-time parent. I am now ready to be a software developer again.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I was born and raised in Morristown, NJ, but I have lived in the Atlanta area for my entire adult life.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I love listening to music... on the radio, my music library, or live. I love classic rock and alternative.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Designing and developing web pages that average people will use.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Duluth, GA</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>My brain has been stagnating for the last 20 years. I have no regrets about my time as a parent, but it's time to move on to the next phase of my life.</p>
